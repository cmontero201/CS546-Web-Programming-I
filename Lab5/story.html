                    There is not a single place I can walk into with my phone, without at least one person raising the all to familiar question: "Whoa, no case?" The decision to not have an case on my all glass
                    iPhone (an all phones that preceded) is a personal and difficult decison. While some may see having a case on their phone is a means to preserve the beauty of the (costly) phone, I see a case as 
                    an ugly obstruction to the beauty of something I've used my hard earned money to aqcuire.

                    The iPhone XS is, arguably, the most beautifully designed phone to date. The chasis of the phone is an undenieable eye catching all glass design. Unfortunatley, the phone is as beautiful as it is 
                    fragile. I have had to replace this phone at least 4 times. AppleCare+ has certainly been a good invetment, but that only covers 2 incidents of accidental damage. So the other two incidents required some 
                    persuasion and hard earned cash.

                    Although I am not one to drop my phone (only two of my 15 broken phones were my fault), I surround myself with people who are not as careful. My friends have dropped my phone 8 times. And the remaining 
                    damages were caused by my amazing niece and nephews. Despite all these incidents, I refuse to put a phone case on. I have to much respect for the design of the phone.
