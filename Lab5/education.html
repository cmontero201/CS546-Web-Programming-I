                    <p> My favorite class during my high school career was defintiely AP Chemisry. For some reason, every aspect of the course made so much sense to me. This course influenced my decision to pursue an
                        undergraduate degree as a Chemsitry major..

                    <h2> Boston University </h2>

                    <p> Introduction to Engineering Design was a course that had the largest impact on me during my time at BU. After several discouraging encounters within the Chemistry department at my university, 
                        I decided to switch my major into the College of Engineering. This was my first engineering course, and it solidified my decision to pursue an engineering degree.
